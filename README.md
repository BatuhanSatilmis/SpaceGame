# SpaceGame
My Space Game Project from first year in computer engineering -We drive our spaceship with a flat plane. -Our ship can fire with the "Ctrl" key. -We have 10 fires, if we shoot more than 10 we lose the game. -Our target is 2 black holes, one of our targets is faster, the other moves more slowly in a horizontal plane. -If we hit targets with 10 shots we win the game. -We are able to control our spaceship with the direction keys.   The references sites I get help include:  -stackoverflow.com -java2s.com -github.com -programcreek.com -coderanch.com  Another info:I wanted put a background picture of my project, but I can't solve in the problem so I gave it a black background color.
