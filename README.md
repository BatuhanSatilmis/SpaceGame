# SpaceGame
My Space Game Project from first year in computer engineering 
-We drive our spaceship with a flat plane. -Our ship can fire with the "Ctrl" key. 
-We have 10 fires, if we shoot more than 10 we lose the game. -Our target is 2 black holes, one of our targets is faster, the other moves more slowly in a horizontal plane. 
-If we hit targets with 10 shots we win the game. -We are able to control our spaceship with the direction keys.

Another info:I wanted put a background picture of my project, but I can't solve in the problem so I gave it a black background color.
